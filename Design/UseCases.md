# Use Cases

This document outlines the use cases that will influence the choices for our project.

## UC1
**Actor:** Homeowner 

**Use Case:** As a homeowner, I can create an account on the app by entering my email and creating a password. This is necessary as user authentication and security is a key aspect of a mobile application.

    * Creating a password 

This points to the business requirement BR1 by ensuring a secure manner that users can access and use the app.

## UC2
